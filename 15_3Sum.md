## Key points

1. Use the method: **Two Pointer**

   First, sort the list and put one pointer at head and another one at the tail.

   Second, if sum is smaller than reference, increase head pointer. If sum is larger than reference, decrease tail pointer.

2. **Avoid duplicate cases** for two pointer. Checking if an element is in a list cost a lot of time. So we can avoid happen by trick on playing with the pointer. Pay attention to how to avoid duplicate cases in this problem. I have marked the lines with this trick.

## Code:

```python 3
class Solution:

    def threeSum(self, nums):
        len_nums = len(nums)
        if len_nums == 0:
            return []

        result = []

        nums.sort()

        p1 = 0

        for p1 in range(0, len_nums-1):
            p2 = p1+1
            p3 = len_nums-1

            if p1 > 0 and nums[p1] == nums[p1-1]:     # to avoid repetition for p1
                continue

            while p2 < p3:
                tSum = nums[p1]+nums[p2]+nums[p3]

                if tSum > 0:
                    p3 -= 1

                elif tSum < 0:
                    p2 += 1

                else:
                    result.append([nums[p1], nums[p2], nums[p3]])

                    while p2 < p3 and nums[p2] == nums[p2+1]:        # to avoid repetition for p2
                        p2 += 1
                    while p2 < p3 and nums[p3] == nums[p3-1]:         # to avoid repetition for p3
                        p3 -= 1

                    p2 += 1
                    p3 -= 1

        return result
